Nutrient Density is the amount of nutrition a food provides per gram. One reason we see so much degenerative disease is because the Modern Western Diet is very low in Nutrient Density. The most nutrient dense foods are organs. Gram for gram, there is no food that even comes close, nutritionally, to liver.

Excerpt from *Deep Nutrition* by Dr. Shanahan:
>The liver is the storage place or the 'savings bank' of the body. If there is an excess of protein, sugar, vitamins, and any mineral except calcium and phosphorus, part of the excess is stored in the liver until it is needed....Liver is, therefore, nutritionally the most outstanding meat which can be purchased.

**My advice on Pillar II:** Eat organs! This is not an optional pillar. At the risk of sounding like a broken record: Remember, our ancestors ate the entire animal, nose to tail, and our body adapted to need nutrients found only in certain parts of the animal that are missing in the Modern Western Diet.

Consider the ancient wisdom: **Like Supports Like**

There is good evidence now that eating a specific organ helps that same organ in your body. This makes sense as that organ has all the pre-formed biological components that our body also needs. For example, if you have an under functioning thyroid, there is no better remedy than to the eat the thyroid from a previously healthy animal. I've dramatically helped several family members and friends overcome thyroid problems through a few simple steps, one of which is the daily consumption of high quality thyroid and adrenal glands (more to come on this topic).
If you aren't ready to take the plunge and buy whole organs yet, start with high quality dessicated organ supplements. I'd recommend everyone take a full spectrum organ supplement, especially focused on liver and brain.
