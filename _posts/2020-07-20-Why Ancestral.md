Before diving into the second pillar of the Human Diet, let's zoom out. Why am I looking to our ancestors and nature for guidance?

Consider the state of our health in the modern United States:
- At least half of adults have prediabetes.
- Almost 40% will get cancer in their lifetime.
- 650,000 people die every year from heart disease.
- Half of people are obese.
- The average person needs several cups of coffee just to make it through the day.
- Depression and anxiety are "normal" now.

Contrast that with, for example, the health of the Innuit or Eskimo peoples on their native diet of almost exclusively whole seafood (whale, fish, seal) and whole caribou. They have perfectly formed skeletons, perfect teeth, and more than twice the thickness of the skull as us. They aren't plagued by modern degenerative diseases, such as those listed above, and have incredibly good blood panels. Hearty, strong, full of energy, happy. These are all words regularly used to describe these people.
Note: Learn more about these impressive people by reading *The Fat of the Land* by Vilhjalmur Stefansson.

Something is clearly wrong with our way of life. We are paying the price for abandoning our nature. The modern person is only a shell, not coming close to their potential. For this reason, and many more, we must study the wisdom of traditional knowledge, proven successful for thousands of years, to teach us how to live.
