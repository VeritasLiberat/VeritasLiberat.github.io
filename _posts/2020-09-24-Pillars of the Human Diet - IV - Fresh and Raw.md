An oxidation-reduction reaction is where one positively charged molecule steals an electron from another molecule. The molecule that lost an electron is said to have been oxidized. For many bodily processes, oxidation is both necessary and good. But, when there is an over abundance of positively charged molecules, oxidation can get out of hand and destroy healthy biological structures. This is where antioxidants come in. Antioxidants are compounds that inhibit oxidation, and the amount of antioxidants in food begins to decrease once the organisms dies. Fresh, whole foods, including raw animal products, contain a safe and balanced blend of antioxidants because all living organisms use them to prevent damage. (In a later column I'll talk about the most powerful antioxidant. Hint: It's not food!)

While 'fresh' applies to both plant and animal products, 'raw' only applies to animal products. Heat destroys nutrients in animal products, making them unusable by our body. In plants though, most nutrients are only bio-available if they are heated (or fermented and sprouted as discussed before). The retinoids (Vitamin A precursors) in carrots, for example, are only about 1% usable when raw, but closer to 30% bio-available when cooked. This is partly because the nutrients in plants are very different than the nutrients in animals, but mostly due to the structure of the plant locking those nutrients in.

Excerpt from *Deep Nutrition* by Dr. Shanahan:

>Locked within cellulose-rich cell walls, vitamins and minerals in high-cellulose plant products pass right through our omnivore's digestive system. Without heat or caustic chemicals, cellulose can only be broken down using specialized bacteria and extended gut-fermentation - something humans lack the intestinal yardage to accomplish (though they can replicate it via fermentation)...While gaining access to many of the nutrients in plants often requires judicious use of heat, many animal products are so abundant in nutrients that adding thermal energy risks fusing them together. This is why we need to cook our meat so gently, and why raw meat and seafood dishes comprise a valuable part of many international diets.

**My advice on Pillar IV:** Minimize raw plant consumption, because they are the least nutrient dense foods, and maximize raw animal consumption, because they are the most nutrient dense foods in existence. Try to eat fresh (killed the same day) wherever possible. Wild caught Sashimi, pasture raised raw eggs (you probably wouldn't believe me if I told you how many raw eggs I eat per day), grass fed raw milk, and dehydrated raw organ supplements are all great options.
