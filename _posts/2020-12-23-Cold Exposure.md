Mitochondria are systems within our cells that turn fat and sugar into ATP, which the cell can use for energy. When exposed to cold temperatures, our body responds with the magical process of Mitochondrial Biogenesis, the creation of new Mitochondria. Metabolic Health is largely a product of Mitochondrial Health, and cold exposure is a great method to improve the functioning of your Mitochondria.

Exposure to cold also has many other benefits, such as the release of a powerful neurotransmitter Norepinephrine. Elevated levels of Norepinephrine positively affect mood, energy levels, ability to focus, and more. Because it increases neural plasticity, your brain's ability to change, both memory and capacity to learn new information are improved.

What you can do: Cold Showers. Take a shower as you usually do in warm water (or scalding hot in the case of my fianc√©e). At the end, turn the temperature down to tap cold. Breathe deeply, relax your muscles, and focus on the experience. Don't be somewhere else mentally. Accept the situation and be present. Stay there for 60-90 seconds. If you can't stay in that long right away, start with 10 seconds and work your way up.

Or, you can go outside in the winter with progressively less clothing (making sure to follow local laws of course!) and stay out a little longer each time. In the winter, I usually walk my dog with no jacket, and I often put on shorts. I wear a hat and gloves though because there isn't a ton of benefit to having cold hands and ears and it's quite uncomfortable. What you're trying to do is lower your whole body temperature.

I recommend cold exposure rather than a cup of coffee. You will feel more relaxed, in a better mood, and have more energy.
