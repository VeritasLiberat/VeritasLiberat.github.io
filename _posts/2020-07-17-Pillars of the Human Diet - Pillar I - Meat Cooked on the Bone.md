Any food that tastes good, which our hunter gatherer ancestors had access to, is healthy. Through this lens, meat on the bone with skin and fat tastes better because it is more nutritious. Boneless, skinless, lean cuts of meat taste bland because they are largely devoid of the most important nutrients our bodies need.

Excerpt from *Deep Nutrition* by Dr. Shanahan:
>When cooking meat, the more everything stays together - fat, bone, marrow, skin, and other connective tissue - the better... The better the material you start with, the better it tastes, and the better it is for you. For that reason, and more, animals raised humanely and pastured on mineral-rich soil are best.

**My advice on Pillar 1:** Regularly eat high quality animal products. High quality means the animal was raised on a pasture (if you're buying pre-packaged it will say either Grass-Fed or Pasture-Raised), so that it can eat its natural diet, get plenty of sunlight, and move around freely. It also means the animal was not fed GMO crops, given any antibiotics, or highly processed. 

Do not eat factory farmed, grain fed, animals. Not only are these practices horribly inhumane, the products produced by them are not just devoid of most nutrition, they actually contain many toxins. Find local farmers who raise their animals right, and buy directly from them.

Try to incorporate more parts of the animal. Opt for the Rib Steak rather than the Ribeye. Go for the 80/20 ground beef rather than the 90/10. Buy bones and make bone broth. Remember, our ancestors ate the entire animal, nose to tail, and our body adapted to need nutrients found only in certain parts of the animal that are missing in the Modern Western Diet.
