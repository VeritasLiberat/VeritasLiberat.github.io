Dr. Francis Pottenger also performed nutrition research in the 1930's. His experiments involved feeding groups of cats either raw animal products (meat, organs, bones, milk) or cooked animal products. After 10 years, several generations on the raw food diet were in excellent health by every measurable marker.

The cats fed the cooked food diet did not fare so well. By the end of the first generation, they already began developing degenerative disease and lacked energy. The second generation had poorly developed skeletons, especially in the skull, and more degenerative disease. The third generation had significantly degenerated to the point that very few were fertile, and none of the much smaller (in size, mass, and population) fourth generation lived past 6 months.

The good news is that this degeneration is reversible. Cats in the third generation cooked food group were switched over to a raw food diet and became more healthy quite quickly. They then produced a new generation which was properly developed and had far less degenerative disease.

This study shows that simply eating the "wrong" foods for our body is enough to produce terrible results. Cooked animal products are not nutritious enough to supply cats with all they need to properly develop, but raw animal products are. What are the "right" and "wrong" foods for humans? Stay tuned.
