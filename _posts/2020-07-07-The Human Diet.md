Dr. Catherine Shanahan, a biochemist who was inspired by the traditional human population research done by Weston Price, looked at the scientific consensus on the diet of many animals. She noticed that it is easy to learn about what wolves eat in nature, which she would call the "Wolf Diet", or the Salmon Diet, or the Lion Diet. However, learning about what Humans eat in nature is difficult. The research had not been done, or compiled effectively, and certainly wasn't common knowledge. The average person today has almost no idea what their ancestors ate just a few hundred years ago, and certainly not before civilization. Disappointed with this severed connection we have with our roots, she set out to determine the **Human Diet**.

After extensive Anthropological, Biological, Chemical, and Historical research, she decided that there are "Four Pillars" of the Human Diet. These are four types or groups of foods that all traditional peoples ate, including our ancestors, which give our body the necessary resources to function optimally. None of these pillars can be skipped if excellent health is the goal. She also calls out certain modern foods that absolutely must be avoided in order to follow the Human Diet. A population that follows the Human Diet will achieve good health. We will dive into each of these pillars first, in the coming days.
