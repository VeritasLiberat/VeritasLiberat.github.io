Fermentation is the amazing process of pre-digestion, preservation, and nutrient enhancement all rolled into one.

Excerpt from *Deep Nutrition* by Dr. Shanahan:
>Bacteria are capable of transforming indigestible, bland, and even toxic compounds into nourishing and delicious foods...Pound for pound, fermented material will have more nutrition packed into it than the raw material it came from because, aside from acting like miniature detoxification machines, microbes add heaps of nutrients to whatever it is they're growing in...As if it's not enough that they can free up minerals, preserve our food, manufacture vitamins, and clean up the nasty plant chemicals our bodies can't handle, once inside your body they will literally fight for your life.

When she says fight for your life, she's referring the powerful effects of probiotics on our gut, and thus immune system. Having a symbiotic, or mutually beneficial, gut biome is crucial to good health and eating fermented food adds tons of helpful organisms to your body. These boost your immunity (the immune system is located nearly entirely in the gut), fight depression (almost all serotonin is made in the gut), keep digestion running smoothly, and produce many other benefits.

**My advice on Pillar III - Fermentation:** Ferment your own foods! Right now I have kombucha, sauerkraut, sourdough, and water kefir fermenting in my house, and plan to start yogurt as well in the near future. I used to have terrible gut problems, as I know many Americans do, but by following the ancient tradition of fermentation, my gut is in far better shape than ever. If you're not ready to make your own food, then start by buying kombucha, whole milk yogurt with no sweeteners, or sauerkraut and make them part of your daily diet.
This is my favorite topic to talk about because it has such a measurable and noticeable improvement on people's quality of life. For example, my mom couldn't handle dairy for decades, but last year she started drinking kombucha and eating yogurt everyday and now she can digest dairy with no issue. Traditional people fermented food for good reason, and you should too.
