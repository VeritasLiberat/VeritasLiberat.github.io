**Veritas Liberat** is a Latin phrase that means **Truth Frees**.

We are all bound by known and unknown mental barriers and thought patterns. Our understanding and assumptions about the world drive our behavior and collective conscious experience. New information offers a novel perspective, and  true information provides the key to escape these mental prisons. As our worldview aligns more closely with reality, we become better adapted to our environment. This leads to greater health, wellbeing, and prosperity.

The current conventionally recognized model of the universe is drifting further and further from the truth every day. Our failing health is evidence of this disconnection. The Modern Western Diet is not a healthy diet, but one that traps people in a low energy unmotivated brain fog which makes learning very difficult. Discovering the truth about health first is important because it provides the energy, focus, and mental clarity to allow research into other topics.

**Goal:** To improve the health of as many people as possible by spreading true information.
