    <p>You have health problems. Everyone does today. The first question I would ask you is: Are you eating the Human Diet? Remember what happened to Pottenger’s cats when they didn’t eat the Cat Diet. Their health deteriorated rapidly, leading to infertility and thus the end of the experiment (and the cats). The Standard Western Diet is NOT the Human Diet. In fact it contains none of the four crucial components of the Human Diet. Let’s recap those four pillars.</p>

<p><strong>Pillar I</strong> - Meat Cooked on the Bone: Leave the animal as intact as possible. Cook a whole turkey or chicken, a whole leg of lamb, or a steak with the bone attached. Eat all the fat, skin, and connective tissue. Then, use the bones to make bone broth.</p>

<p><strong>Pillar II</strong> - Organs: The most nutrient dense foods are organs. Our body evolved eating them and now requires them to operate. High end grocery stores now sell ground meat with organs (like liver and heart) mixed in. Organ supplements are available online as well (<a href="https://ancestralsupplements.com/">Ancestral Supplements</a> and  <a href="https://organsupplements.com/">Organ Supplements</a> are both great).</p>

<p><strong>Pillar III</strong> - Fermentation and Sprouting: Fermented food is incredible for your health, especially gut health. Sprouted seeds are nutritious, where raw seeds are damaging to your body and often count as a net negative in nutrition. If you have gut problems, follow this pillar strictly (avoid unsprouted seeds and load up on fermented foods) and you will notice major improvements!</p>

<p><strong>Pillar IV</strong> - Fresh and Raw: Fresh foods contain the highest levels of antioxidants, which minimize oxidative damage to the body. Raw animal products are the most nutritious versions of animals, and raw plant products are the least nutritious versions of plants. When cooking animal products, the less cooking the better (rare or medium rare at most). Don’t eat a lot of raw plants. Instead eat them cooked, or better yet, fermented and/or sprouted.</p>

<p>I urge everyone to make small steps towards the Human Diet. Even a small step will make a difference, and these improvements to your quality of life will motivate you to take more steps in this direction. I also highly recommend reading <a href="https://drcate.com/deep-nutrition-why-your-genes-need-traditional-food/">Deep Nutrition by Catherine Shanahan, M.D.</a> It provides a stellar foundation for understanding how our body works and reacts to food. If there’s one book you read about health, make it this.</p>
