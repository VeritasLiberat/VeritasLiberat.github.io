    <p>Animals try to kill you before you eat them. Plants try to kill you after you eat them.
Many plants, including ones that are considered “healthy” in our modern world, are packed with damaging compounds. People who regularly consume raw seeds - modern grains, legumes, and nuts - often have severely depleted levels of many important minerals such as zinc, as well as a host of gut issues.
Anti-nutrients, one type of damaging plant compound, can even count as negative nutrition. Phytic and Oxalic acid, found in high levels in seeds, actually bind to minerals in your gut, making them unusable by your body!
Lectins, a class of proteins also in seeds, break down the lining of your gut. This then allows anything to leak into your bloodstream, wreaking havoc on your body in many ways, such as causing autoimmune disorders and systemic inflammation.</p>

<p>Most people notice major health improvements when they cut seeds from their diet entirely, but there is a better way.</p>

<p>Excerpt from <em>Deep Nutrition</em> by Dr. Shanahan:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Seeds are designed to greedily hang on to their stored proteins, fats, and minerals over extended periods of time. To that end, the plant sheaths them in a hard, nearly impenetrable carapace and locks down nutrients with chemical binders that digestive enzymes can’t loosen. Moistening the seeds for a few days activates the plant’s own enzymes-including phytase, which digests phytates-to soften the seed, free up bound nutrients, and even create new ones by converting stored starch and fatty acids into proteins and vitamins.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>My advice on Pillar III - Sprouting:</strong> Never eat raw seeds. When looking for bread, if the grains were not sprouted before grinding, do not eat them. If beans were not soaked for a few days, do not eat them. If nuts were not germinated, do not eat them.
Almost all modern bread is made from wheat berries which have not been sprouted, and contain far higher levels of Lectins than ancient grains. Look for flours that are heirloom, such as Einkorn or Spelt, and sprouted. Use these to make your own sourdough.</p>

<p>Raw seeds do far more harm to your body than you might think. There is not a single known, recorded, group of traditional people who ate seeds without sprouting them first.</p>
