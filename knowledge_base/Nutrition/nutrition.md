Nutrition is the most important component of health.

Proper nutrition means giving our body what it needs and avoiding damaging compounds. Eat whole, nutrient dense animal foods, especially eggs, organs like liver, and raw dairy, because they are essential sources of everything our body requires.

Dietary Recommendations:

* Grass Fed: Beef Liver, Beef, Butter, Tallow, Bone Marrow, Raw Cheese
* Pasture Raised: Raw Eggs, Pork Belly, Lamb
* Wild Caught: Fermented Cod Liver Oil, Fish Roe, Sardines (including skin, bones, and organs), Molluscs (Mussels, Scallops, Oysters)
