Water is an essential component of life, and drinking clean water is fundamental to health.

Tap water contains Fluorine, Chlorine, Pharmaceuticals, Heavy Metals, Plastics, and other harmful compounds which damage our body. Only drink water that has been filtered by either Reverse Osmosis or Distillation, or Spring Water from an uncontaminated source.

Drink plenty of water each day, but not out of plastic. Instead use glass, stainless steel, ceramic, or any other stable material.
