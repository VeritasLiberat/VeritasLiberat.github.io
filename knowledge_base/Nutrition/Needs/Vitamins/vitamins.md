Vitamins are critical components that allow metabolic processes to occur. Our body is a complex system where trillions of chemical reactions occur regularly. There are many different types of processes, but the total sum of them is called metabolism. These processes must complete at a certain rate in order for life to continue. Enzymes, biological catalysts, allow chemical reactions to occur in a reasonable amount of time. Some enzymes need cofactors to facilitate the reaction. These cofactors, we call vitamins.
