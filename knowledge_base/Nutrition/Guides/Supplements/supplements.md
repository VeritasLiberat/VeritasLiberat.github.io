The perfect diet provides the body all that it needs to operate properly. Unfortunately, due to depleted soil and high levels of toxins, it is necessary to supplement some critical components.

## Minerals

### Iodine

[J. Crow's Lugol's Solution:](https://www.jcrowsmarketplace.com/lugolssolutionofiodine.aspx) Drop about two droppers into a few ounces of water. Add unrefined salt.

### Magnesium

[Magnesium Oil Spray:](https://www.allstarhealth.com/f/life-flo-pure_magnesium_oil.htm) Spray 10-20 times on as much skin as possible before bed. 

Or, soak feet in hot water with one cup of dissolved Magnesium Chloride flakes for 20 minutes.

### Zinc/Copper

[Jarrow's Zinc Copper blend:](https://www.allstarhealth.com/f/jarrow-zinc_balance_15mg.htm) The ratio of Zinc to Copper is important and this ensures you get enough of both. Take one per day.

### Boron

[Borax:](https://pforlife.com/borax-all-natural-sodium-borate-10-mol-mineral-powder.html) Boron, in the form of Sodium Borate, is taken at 1/8 of a teaspoon per day. Add this to your Iodine shot to make things easier.

## Organs

### Full Spectrum

For a good dose of 6 important organs, take at least 3 per day.

### Thyroid

If severe fatigue/lethargy is normal, start with 3 and work up to 6 per day. As energy levels come back, less will be needed as a maintenance dose. I take one per day.

### Adrenals

If caffeine has been used in excess for long periods of time, start with 3 and work up to 6 per day. Abstain from caffeine during this period. Less will be needed as a maintenance dose.

## Vitamins

### Vitamin D3

Unless you absorb 4-6 hours of sun per day, a D3 supplement is required. Recommended dose is 10,000 IU per day topically.

### Vitamin C

Periodically take about a teaspoon into a glass of water. I do this maybe once a week.
