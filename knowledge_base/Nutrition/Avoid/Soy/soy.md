Eating raw legumes is detrimental to our health, but eating soy is especially bad. Soy beans contain dangerously high levels of several damaging compounds which destroy the gut, majorly inhibit endocrine function, and lower nutrient absorption:

* Isoflavones
* Saponins
* Phytic Acid
* Lectins

Never eat soy that hasn't been properly fermented.
