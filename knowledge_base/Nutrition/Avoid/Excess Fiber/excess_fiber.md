Fiber is unnecessary. Our body's ability to ferment fiber in our colon is very minimal.

### Colon Fermentation
Ruminant animals, such as gorillas and cows, have very large colons for fermenting lots of fiber into fat. In humans, a small amount of water soluble fiber can be fermenented into short chain fatty acids, but they can only be used locally to the colon.

## Ketones
A better option is to keep insulin levels low to promote ketogenesis, which is the state where the liver produces ketones for the body's fuel source. Ketones share many of the benefits of the short chain fatty acids produced from fermentation in the colon, but can be utilized by the entire body. Most of our body, especially our brain, runs better on ketones. Metabolizing ketones also produces far less mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress than glucose.
