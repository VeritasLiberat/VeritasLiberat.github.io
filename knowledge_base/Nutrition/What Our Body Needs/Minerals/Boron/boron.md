Boron is essential for bone health, sex hormone production, and endocrine health. It also binds to toxic halides, helping your body remove them. It even has an anti-inflammatory effect, potentially explaining the low rates of arthritis among people with high boron intake.

## Borax
Borax, Sodium Borate, is a boron containing salt that occurs naturally. Consuming small amounts, between 1/8 and 1/4 tsp, of high quality food grade Borax everyday is good for health.
