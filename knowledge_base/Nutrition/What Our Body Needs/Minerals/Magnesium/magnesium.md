title: Magnesium
---

Other than Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen; Magnesium is the central mineral of life. It is a key component of cells, bones, tissues, and nearly all physiological processes. Without adequate magnesium levels in the cells, many of the body's vital functions grind to a halt. With roughly 80% of the population in the United States critically deficient in Magnesium, this is truly an epidemic.

## Correcting Deficiency
The form of Magnesium that the human metabolic system recognizes and assimilates most readily is Magnesium Chloride, the same form contained in seawater. To properly adminster Magnesium for optimal absorption, apply transdermally. Transdermal Magnesium application is an easy way to correct chronic degenerative conditions caused by deficiency. Simply spray the skin with a Magnesium Chloride solution or soak the feet for 20 minutes in a bucket of hot water and a minimum of a few ounces of Magnesium Chloride solution.
