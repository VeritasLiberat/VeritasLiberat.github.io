The Omega-3 and Omega-6 Fatty Acids are essential building blocks for our body.

### Omega-3

The long chain Omega-3s from animals, such as EPA and DHA, are crucial for proper brain development and function, as well as many other bodily structures.

### Omega-6

Omega-6s are necessary for brain, hormone, and nervous system function.

### Ratio

The ratio of Omega-3 to Omega-6 Fatty Acids in our diet is extremely important. Too low of a ratio, meaning a large Omega-6 and small Omega-3 intake, leads to many modern diseases as well as chronic inflammation. In order to maintain a good ratio:

* Eat plenty of EPA and DHA by regularly consuming
  * Whole Wild Caught Fish
  * Wild Caught Fish Eggs
  * Wild Caught Fish Liver (Ex: Cod Liver and Fermented Cod Liver Oil)
  * Pasture Raised Egg Yolks
* Avoid the following foods
  * Seed and Vegetable Oils (Ex: Canola and Soybean Oil)
  * Factory Farmed, Grain Fed Meat
