Heat exposure from a sauna is a very effective way to remove toxins from your body.

## Traditional Sauna
A Traditional Sauna heats the air to around 170 degrees Fahrenheit. This causes the body to produce sweat. Contained in that sweat is many toxins, making your skin the largest detoxification pathway.

## Infrared Sauna
The air temperature in an Infrared Sauna is ideally about 110 degrees Fahrenheit, but mostly relies on infrared light to heat your body. The infrared frequencies generated by the lamps offer additional benefits over a traditional sauna as they initiate cellular regeneration, release Nitric Oxide to improve blood flow, and stimulate mitochondria which increases ATP production.

I converted my basement bathroom into an infrared sauna by simply adding 4 infrared lamps attached to a wall mounted shelf, a stool, and a space heater. With some added weather stripping around the door, it consistently maintains a temperature over 100 degrees.
