Alzheimer's Disease is a neurodegenerative disease marked by the brain's inability to utilize glucose as an energy source.

### Cause

Insulin Resistance is the main cause, leading this disease to be regarded as Type 3 Diabetes. Lack of fat in the diet, especially DHA, is another cause of all forms of brain degeneration.

### Prevention

##### Insulin Resistance

Become more insulin sensitive by eating a Low Carbohydrate Diet and Fasting regularly.

##### Fat

Feed your brain by eating plenty of Wild Caught Whole Fish, Fish Eggs, and Pasture Raised Eggs.
