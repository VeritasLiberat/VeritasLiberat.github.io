Getting plenty of sunlight is crucial to optimal health. 30 minutes of direct sun exposure on as much skin as possible near solar noon is the minimum requirement.

Tan skin is attractive because it is a marker of good health.

### Sunburn
Getting "burned" by the sun is not healthy, but is avoidable. Only expose yourself to the sun as much as your skin can handle. Early in the year, when your skin is lighter, you will tan in a shorter time window than later in the year, after your skin has had a chance to darken.

#### Omega Ratio

Maintaining a proper Omega-3 to Omega-6 ratio greatly reduces the likelihood of sun burn because it allows a longer sun exposure time before redness occurs.

Avoid vegetable oils and eat plenty of wild caught whole fish and fish eggs.

#### Retinol

A diet rich in the active form of Vitamin A, Retinol, allows skin, which may have received minor damage, to repair quickly.

Eat plenty of pasture raised liver and eggs.

#### Collagen

Consuming collagen also allows the skin to repair more quickly and remain stronger.

Drink bone broth regularly.
