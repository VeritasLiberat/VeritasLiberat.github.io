title: Grounding
---

Grounding, by touching skin to the Earth, restores and maintains our body's natural electrical state, promoting the optimal function of biological processes.

### Oxidation

Many biological processes produce positively charged molecules, which then cause oxidative damage. The most efficient way to remove these are through the electrical process of grounding. Electrons from the Earth quickly neutralize these positively charged molecules, acting as a powerful antioxidant.

### Inflammation

Access to this reservoir of electrons significantly reduces chronic inflammation, and even speeds up the healing process.

### Recommendations

* Sleep grounded
* Be barefoot on the Earth for at least 30 minutes per day.
