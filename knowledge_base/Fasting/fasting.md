Increasing the amount of time spent not eating allows your body to enter a "regeneration" mode. Utilizing this beneficial state regularly is necessary for optimal health.

### Autophagy

The process of "self-eating" known as autophagy is a catabolic bodily state that breaks down damaged structures in order to reuse their components for growth. Our ancestors spent significant amounts of time in this state, improving their body composition and preventing many degenerative diseases.
