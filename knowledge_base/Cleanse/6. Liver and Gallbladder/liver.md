title: Liver - Gallbladder

Throughout the course of a normal life, especially one subjected to the toxic environment and diet of the modern western world, stones made of mostly calcium form and accumulate in the liver and the gallbladder.

Both the liver and the gallbladder have many ducts, very thin tubes, where these stones tend to accumulate. This interferes with the normal functioning of these organs, blocking important processes such as the release of bile from the gallbladder or the purging of toxins from the liver.

It is hard to overstate the importance of a well functioning liver, as it is essentially the foundation of metabolic health. Thus, clearing out these stones is a critical step on the path to optimal health.

This cleanse has been done by myself, as well as several friends and family. We all attest that it works well, is not uncomfortable, and produces a noticeable improvement in overall sense of well being.

## What You Need

- Six Quarts (6 * 32oz) of Organic Apple Juice
- 3 tsp [Orthophosphoric Acid](https://www.naturalhealthcarestore.com/shop/product/details/334-super-phos-by-dews-21st-century-products)
- 4 Tablespoons of [Food Grade (USP) Epsom Salts](https://www.amazon.com/Pure-Organic-Ingredients-Magnesium-All-Natural/dp/B075MV4F58/ref=pd_lpo_2?pd_rd_i=B075MV4F58&psc=1)
- 1/2 cup (4oz) of cold-pressed, Organic Olive Oil
- 6oz of fresh grapefruit juice (pink is best), or fresh lemon and orange juice combined
- Two 1 Quart Wide Mouth Mason Jars

## Procedure

The liver cleanse requires 6 days of preparation, followed by 16 to 20 hours of actual cleansing, which is best done over a weekend when you are not under any pressure and have enough time to rest.

Make sure you cleanse your colon before starting this preparation.

While on the liver cleanse regimen, avoid taking any medication, vitamins, or supplements that are not absolutely necessary. Do not drink alcohol. It is important not to give the liver any extra work that could interfere with its cleansing efforts.

### Preparation
1. Drink 1 Quart of apple juice per day for 6 days. On the 4th, 5th, and 6th day also take Orthophosphoric acid. Drink the apple juice slowly throughout the day, between meals.  Avoid drinking the juice during, just before, and in the first two hours after meals, and in the evening.

2. On the Sixth Day: Drink the quart of apple juice with Orthophosphoric acid in the morning. If you feel hungry in the morning, you may eat oatmeal (Sprouted and Organic ideally). Do not add anything to the oatmeal. Fruit or fruit juices are fine to drink. For lunch eat only rice (preferably basmati rice) and flavor it with a little unrefined salt. Do NOT eat any fat or protein or you might feel ill during the actual cleanse. Feel free to skip breakfast or lunch if it’s not needed. Do not eat or drink anything (except water) after 1:30 p.m., otherwise you may have difficulties passing stones.

### Cleanse
The actual cleanse begins on the evening of the Sixth Day and continues into the Seventh Day.

1. 6:00 PM - Add 4 Tablespoons of Epsom Salts (Magnesium Sulfate) to 24 ounces of purified water in a mason jar. Squeeze the juice of one lemon. Stir or shake well until dissolved. This makes four 6oz servings. Drink your first 6oz portion now. If the taste is too unpleasant, drink it with a large straw, or close your nostrils while drinking.

2. 8:00 PM - Drink the second serving of Epsom Salts.

3. 9:45 PM - Prepare the oil and juice mixture. Add half a cup of olive oil to a mason jar. Squeeze the grapefruits or lemon and oranges until you have 6oz of juice. Combine and shake very well. Prepare to go to sleep after the next step.

4. 10:00 PM - Stand next to your bed and drink the mixture quickly. Lay down on your back immediately, with your head propped slightly. Do not move or speak for at least 20 minutes. Ideally you should fall asleep now.

5. Night - If you need to have a bowel movement, listen to your body.

6. 6:00 AM - Drink the third serving of Epsom Salts.

7. 8:00 AM - Drink the fourth serving of Epsom Salts.

8. 10:00 AM - You may drink juice now.

9. 11:00 AM - You may eat a light meal

10. Afternoon into Evening - Gradually return to your normal diet.

### Post-Cleanse
Two to Three days after the cleanse, do another brief colon cleanse with one or two doses of Colosan to clear out any remaining stones.

### Scheduling
One cleanse will not remove all stones. Every 3 weeks, you can do another cleanse until you no longer purge stones. This could take up to 8 cleanses.

## Expected Results

Epsom Salts, being a strong laxative, will cause you to have many bowel movements. At first, these will clear your colon of any waste from digested food. Once that has been expelled, the rest will mainly be bile and stones from both the Liver and Gallbladder. These stones will vary in size and color. Most of them are very small, but you may see some as large as a pea (and possibly larger). You can expect dozens or hundreds in total for a single cleanse.
