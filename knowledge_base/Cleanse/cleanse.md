## Clean Body Clean Mind

Clearing the body of toxins is foundational to good health.

The following cleanses, in the listed order, will have a profound effect on anyone who follows them.

It is recommended to be on a Veritas Liberat style diet for at least a few months before beginning this cleanse protocol.

Regular use of an [Infrared Sauna](/knowledge_base/Hormesis/Sauna/sauna.html) is highly recommended to augment any detoxification protocol.

## Schedule
Following this schedule is relatively important to make the entire process as comfortable and safe as possible.

#### 1. [Halogen](/knowledge_base/Cleanse/1.%20Halogen/halogen.html)
A Halogen cleanse should be started before beginning any other cleanses. As there is no end to a lifestyle that keeps halogens in balance, feel free to move on to the next cleanse at once.

#### 2. [Colon](/knowledge_base/Cleanse/2.%20Colon/colon.html)
The intestines and colon should be cleared before moving on so that toxins can be effectively eliminated through this pathway.

#### 3. [Kidney](/knowledge_base/Cleanse/3.%20Kidney/kidney.html)
After the colon cleanse, the kidneys should be cleared as well so that the blood is effectively filtered of toxins.

#### 4. [Parasite](/knowledge_base/Cleanse/4.%20Parasite/parasite.html)
Now that the bodies main detoxification pathways are functioning better, parasites, often the largest toxic load on the system, must be removed.

#### 5. [Oxidizer](/knowledge_base/Cleanse/5.%20Oxidizer/oxidizer.html)
Once many parasites are gone, a strong oxidizer will further remove parasites, heavy metals, and generally shift the body into an aerobic terrain which produces beneficial outcomes.

#### 6. [Liver and Gallbladder](/knowledge_base/Cleanse/Liver%20and%20Gallbladder/liver.html)
Since the liver and gallbladder store stones as well, these must be eliminated for optimal metabolic health. It is recommended to remove parasites before stones though as parasites in the liver can inhibit the passing of stones.

#### 7. [Heavy Metal](/knowledge_base/Cleanse/Heavy%20Metal/heavy_metal.html)
The modern environment loads the body with large amounts of heavy metals, and the parasite cleanse will, among other effects, release more heavy metals into the body. Various heavy metal chelation and adsorption is recommended in other cleanses, but a focused heavy metal cleanse is a crucial final step.
