The Halogens are a group of elements that all have a single slot available for an electron to bind. Because of this, they can all bind to the same biological structures in our body. This means that one halogen can interfere with another.

There are four relevant Halogens that will be discussed, which are:

1. Iodine - A necessary mineral that has many positive effects on health, but most notably associated with the Thyroid.

2. Chlorine - Exists either as Chloride, which is when Chlorine is bound to another element such as Sodium (Sodium Chloride - NaCl), or as Chlorine bound to itself or another gas such as Oxygen in the case of bleach (Sodium Hypochlorite - NaClO). In the form of Chloride it is a necessary macronutrient, but in the form of Chlorine it is toxic.

3. Fluorine - Neurotoxic in all forms. Has a dose dependent relation to IQ, meaning more fluoride intake leads to less intelligence.

4. Bromine - Toxic in all forms.

The purpose of this cleanse is to remove the toxic Halogens from your body and replace them with the nutritious halogens.

## Procedure

Iodine will 'knock' the toxic halogens from your body and bind to that same structure, thereby blocking more toxic halogens from binding there.

### Iodine

Follow the [Iodine Protocol in the Knowledge Base](/knowledge_base/Nutrition/What%20Our%20Body%20Needs/Minerals/Iodine/iodine.html).

### Chlorine

Chlorine is found in tap water, which you should never drink. However, your largest intake of chlorine comes from showering and bathing, so you must purify your water. Either get a whole house water purification system that removes chlorine, or get a chlorine filter for your shower head.

### Fluorine

Fluorine is mainly found in the following two areas:
1. Tap Water. Do not drink tap water. Always drink only water that has been purified by either Reverse Osmosis or Distillation. Uncontaminated spring water is also good.
2. Toothpaste and Mouth Wash. Avoid any dental products that contain added fluoride. Get a good fluoride free toothpaste.

### Bromine

The largest source of Bromine is from conventional flour, because it is added as a conditioner to these processed grain products. Only get unbromated flour, and avoid conventional grain products.

## Expected Results

Supplementing Iodine at this dose will remove a large amount of toxic halogens all at once. This can lead to unpleasant detoxification effects, but these should not last longer than a couple days.
