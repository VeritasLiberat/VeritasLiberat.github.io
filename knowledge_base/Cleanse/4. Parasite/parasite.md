A parasite is an organism which feeds off of another organism, called a host, often to the detriment of the host. Parasites are an inevitable part of life. We can no more rid our lives of parasites as we can of breathing. However, unless a focused effort to remove parasites from the body is undertaken, they can dramatically harm our overall health.
