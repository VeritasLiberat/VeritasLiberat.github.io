A parasite is an organism which feeds off of another organism, called a host, often to the detriment of the host. Parasites are an inevitable part of life. We can no more rid our lives of parasites as we can of breathing. However, unless a focused effort to remove parasites from the body is undertaken, they can dramatically harm our overall health.

Removing parasites drastically reduces the toxic load on the body, improving all aspects of health.

## Procedure
There are many herbs and substances which kill parasites, but only a few are recommended here due to their safety, cost, and ability to kill parasites at all stages of life. Eggs, adolescent, and adult parasites of various species have different weaknesses and so a blend of different herbs is needed to clear them all out. The following are very effective at killing parasites:

- Clove
- Black Walnut Hull
- Wormwood
- Oregano Oil
- Garlic

In addition to killing parasites, pumpkin seeds are effective at paralyzing parasites in the body and inhibiting them from fighting back. One common way that parasites fight back is by releasing ammonia. In order to efficiently detoxify ammonia, the liver uses L-ornithine, so supplementing this amino acid during a parasite cleanse is helpful.

Once killed, the body will flush the parasites into the intestines and colon to be removed. This process has the potential to fill the intenstines with toxins and parasites, and for this reason a standard colon cleanse is recommended every morning during the cleanse.

In order to help neutralize and remove the toxins released by the parasites, a chelator and/or adsorber is recommended to be taken every night such as chlorella, bentonite clay, or zeolite.
